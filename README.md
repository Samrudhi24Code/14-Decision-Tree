Decision Tree Classifier
This repository contains an implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier, a machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. Decision trees split data recursively based on feature values to form a tree structure, helping to make predictions based on learned decision rules.

Features:
Handles both categorical and numerical data.
Includes visualization of the decision tree structure.
Supports entropy and Gini impurity as splitting criteria.
Optimized for maximum depth and minimum sample split to prevent overfitting.
Includes a detailed walkthrough of the algorithm with examples and code.
Use Cases:
Predictive modeling (e.g., churn prediction, loan approval).
Data exploration and feature importance analysis.
Technologies Used:
Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
